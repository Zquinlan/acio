# Academia_to_io
Insert creative tool name for repo above...


## We are designing a command line tool which will generate a jekyll based io website
#### The idea behind these io website for github repo's is that it will increase the readability and accessibility of your code to not only other academics but also the general public if you choose to put in a little extra work.
