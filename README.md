# Academia_to_io (Ac.Io Website)

# Ac.IO is a fast way to generate amazing websites based off github repositories.
 This tool was originally designed to be used by scientists who do not want to spend the time to learn to write markdown, html, etc or other static site generators. The GUI will take in all arguments needed to implement your github.io website, making a gh-pages branch and all necessary contents. It is actively being developed with more themes and distributions of single application packages on the way soon!
